<h1><em>Independence day</em></h1>
<a name="ind_day"></a>
<p class="second">Hence, we celebrate our Independence Day on 15th of August every year.
 There is national holiday on Independence Day.
 There the National Flag is hoisted and the National anthem is 
 sung in chorus. Everybody takes a new oath to serve the country 
 and to do everything to uplift her glory.

The elders remember the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the 
struggle for independence. They pay homage to the great leaders who
 suffered a lot to win our freedom.

This day also inspires us to follow the teaching of peace and
 non-violence that was preached by Mahatma Gandhi, the father of
 our nation.

This day reminds us of our duty and responsibility to the country.
 As the meeting ends with a song, sweets are distributed among all.
 Then, people go to the slums and distribute food and clothes among
 the poor.
 When they come back home they feel very happy.</p>
